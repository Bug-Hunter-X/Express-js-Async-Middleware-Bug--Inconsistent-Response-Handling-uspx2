# Express.js Async Middleware Bug: Inconsistent Response Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inconsistent handling of asynchronous operations within middleware functions. The bug arises from sending a response before an asynchronous operation (e.g., database query) completes, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description
The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route handler that fetches user data from a database. If the user is not found, it correctly sends a 404 response. However, if the user is found, it immediately sends the response without waiting for the database query to complete.  This means that `user` might be undefined leading to a potential error or unexpected response.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct way to handle asynchronous operations in Express.js middleware.  It uses async/await to ensure that the response is sent only after the database query has completed.  This approach prevents inconsistencies and ensures reliable response handling.
